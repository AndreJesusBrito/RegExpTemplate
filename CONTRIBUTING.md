Want to help?
There are many ways you can help.

I want to:
1. [report a bug](#Reporting-a-bug)
2. [make a suggestion](#Making-a-suggestion)
3. [code](#Coding)
4. [work on the documentation](#Work-on-the-documentation)



## Reporting a bug
You found a problem in this project. Please report in the [issues using this format](https://github.com/RegExpTemplate/core/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D).

Before reporting a bug however, please check [for bugs in the issues](https://github.com/RegExpTemplate/core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22bug%22) to make sure that the bug was not reported yet. This will avoid duplicates.

If you also want to work on this bug, then add a comment to let us know.



## Making a suggestion
Suggestions are always welcome. Keep in mind however that this is a core library. Only fundamental features should be implemented. All others should be implemented as [extensions](https://github.com/RegExpTemplate/core#Template-Extensions).

If you think this is relevant to the core then please make your suggestion using [this issue template](https://github.com/RegExpTemplate/core/issues/new?assignees=&labels=suggestion&template=suggestion.md).



## Coding
If you found a bug or want to implement a feature then first please add it in the issues. See [Reporting a bug](#Reporting-a-bug) or [Making a suggestion](#Making-a-suggestion) to know how.

If the feature to implement is small you can skip this part. The idea of suggesting first is that you don't waste time in something that wouldn't be added to the library.

You should wait for an answer before start working on the feature. Once assigned you can fork the repository and start coding. When you done send a pull request.



## Work on the documentation
For now, any correction or addition to the documentation can be directly pull requested. This includes the readme and examples.

For examples follow the same format as the previous examples.
